# Pomodoro

To-do list + Pomodoro app
Link: https://pomotodoro.herokuapp.com/

# Overview

Functionality of the app is to allow users to define a time that they want to spend on a task.
Users should be able to pause the timer and resume the task when they are ready.

# Main Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Passportjs, Mongoose, lodash

# Challenges

1.Time management - ironic when I'm trying to create a time management system (sort of)

2.Working with dates can be abit confusing

3.countdown timer not exactly accurate

4.Timer resets on refresh.. (yet to investigate why)

5.Users all have access to the same task list (no unique sessions attached to them)

# Things that I should have implemented

1. Unique user sessions
2. Completed list that allows users to see their completed list
3. More accurate timer
4. Search functionality
